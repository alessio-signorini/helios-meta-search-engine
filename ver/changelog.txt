4.1g
		First  public  release  of  HELIOS.  Now  the parser scripts reside in the
	directory /parser, and we applied a general cleanup of the code. Comments are
	still need to be refined.	
4.1f
		Added  the  command 'q' to the parser. This command terminate the interest
	in the server, and close the corresponing socket.
4.1e
		Added  STRERROR  description  after the errors alarm to help understanding
	what's happening.
		Modified the E->SOCKET number check. Socket 0 and 1 can be reassigned, and
	is an error considering E->SOCKET<1 an error condition. Replaced by ==-1.
		Added statistic on the RX time of each engine.
		Modified the RANK index when you ask to an engine to start from page 2 for
	example.  Before  it  started reporting RANK=1 for the first entry even if it
	was the 100th. Now it's fixed.
		Added  structure  PARSER  in  the  reported statistic. Now you can know if
	there  were problems parsing one page. For each engine is reported the number
	of requested results and the number of parsed result.
4.1d
		Moved  the  CLOSESOCKET  call  just  after  the  READ=0  check to make the
	function RX	more easy to read.
		Added the CLOSESOCKET call into the SOCKETERROR function. Before, an error
	on a socket left the socket blocked for other uses.
		Enabled support for 30 simultaneous search engines.

4.1c
		Added return SOCKET CHECK also in the REQUESTNEWPAGE function.
		Added   simple  INITIAL  PARAMETERS  CHECK,  just  to  evoid  the  orrible
	SEGMENTATION FAULT when launched without parameters.

4.1b
		Removed  not  useful  assignment  of PAGES in PRINTGRABBEDRESULT function,
	increasing the overall speed.
		Added  CONFIG.PARSER_PRINT  to  config   parameters. If disabled the PRINT
	command  in  parser  scripts will not work. The command line argument "-n" is
	used to disable that option.

4.1a
		Fixed  a bug in the CREATESOCKET function. Now if it failed, the engine is
	set  as NON-INTERESTING and the error is reported in the new ERROR structure.
		Added ERROR CHECKS in the RX and TX functions. If their READ or WRITE fail
	the error is reported, and the engine is set as NON-INTERESTING.
		Added XML structure ERROR, for engines error reporting.

4.0a
		Resolved  a bug in the SEARCH function. Closing the socket suddendly after
	the  last  READ  caused  problems to the IF after the SELECT function. It was
	checking  the  read  and  write  FD_SETs  also  for  closed  sockets, causing
	unpredicible  results. I introduced two new functions that execute a check of
	read&write interest before looking at the corresponding FD_SET.
		Added  CONFIG.SOCKET_TRACE  to  config parameters. If enabled the software
	will print the socket operations (close/open). The command line argument "-s"
	is used to enable that option.

3.9a
		Socket  utilized by one-page searches were not closed, causing problems on
	the  running  machine running-out of socket number. Now when READ=0 and there
	aren't more page to retrive, the socket is suddendly closed.
